mongoDB data is stored in bson and not json...which is like json 

we save data for retore not in text fromat but binary sa we use dumb command..

and to resore data from dumb we use mongo.restore() command


mongostat gives the info about runing mongo inatnces.

BSON is JSON with 2 aditional ype : it has some extra datatype apart from JS and second its not raw test data..


================

collection is like a table but with no schema..i.e data in database may not need to be related..but that dosen't make sense..

Document : same like  row in sql...

Field : same like columen in sql : {key : value}...


=========================


intresting thing about mongo is that when we swuitch to a database in it it will not create it untill we start storing daat in it...
