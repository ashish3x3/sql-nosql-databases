you'd do is:

Create and open a file named opscode.list:
    sudo vim /etc/apt/sources.list.d/opscode.list
Add the required line and save the file:
    deb http://apt.opscode.com/ oneiric main
The above steps can be combined to make a single command:

sudo echo "deb http://apt.opscode.com/ onereic main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/opscode.list
